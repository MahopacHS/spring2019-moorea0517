Would it be difficult to write a program which did the opposite (conversion F to C)? Explain.\nno it wouldnt be hard because its just the reverse operation\n3. Did you store the conversion in a variable before printing it on the last line? I argue this makes your program easier to understand. Why?\nyes i made it a varible first because it makes the code easier to visualize"
